# Challenge 0: Warm Up!

# Objectives
- Learn how to add files on GitHub.
- Understand the process of compiling or rendering scripts or documents.
- How to make assignment submissions and track changes.

# Instructions
1. Open RStudio.
2. Create a new RMarkdown document (a `.Rmd` file) in RStudio (icon with a white page and a green plus sign on the upper left corner).
3. Add a new title and author then click "OK". RStudio will create a default template page.
4. Compile the document by clicking the Knit button (the little blue wool ball). This will ask you how you want to name your output file and were were you want to save it. Once you validate, RStudio will generate an `.Rmd` and an `.html` file. Once the compilation is completed, it will display the rendered `html` page.
5. Upload the newly created R Markdown (`.Rmd`) and HTML (`.html`) files to your challenge repository on GitHub.
6. Add a message to your commit (e.g. "My first submission!")
7. Commit your changes!
