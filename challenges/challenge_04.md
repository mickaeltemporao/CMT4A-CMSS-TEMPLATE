5. Choose where you want to save the project on your computer.

2. Start by "knitting" this document (html or pdf).
    - The document should "knit" without errors. If you have an error here, send a message on Slack!
4. Read and follow the instructions from the rendered document.
    - You can write in English or French. As you know, I do not penalize for any grammar mistakes. You should see this as an opportunity to practice and improve your English skills.
